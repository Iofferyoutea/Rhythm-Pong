## Design
The ball will have an indicator telling players where it will go. We need this to allow for high beats and some movement techniques to be fair.

### Elevator Pitch
Pong but a rhythm game. The ball will hit paddles and walls to the beat. Lots of colours, lots of explosions. You can play alone to try and get a high score, or you can 1v1 someone else.

### Gameplay Loop
The ball will hit the paddle or the wall (singleplayer), or player 1 paddle and player 2 paddle (1v1) (depending on its direction) to the beat of the music. it will spend time in no mans land during the time between the beat.

### Game Modes
Singleplayer: the player can either play a level based system; where one song is a level. Or they can do endless, which will runthrough all the songs, to try and get a high score.

Multiplayer: The same gamemodes, but this time there's another person.

### Ball Movement
The ball could move in many ways. We can swap between different movement mid game.

1: The ball gets away from the paddle quickly, slows when it gets towards the centre, then moves quickly to the destination.

2: Ball moves quickly from one side to the other.

### Maps
There will be one map. Just the basic pong map. It's background, paddle, walls, and ball can all be changed though.

People will be able to create their own maps (backgrounds, etc.) with their own music. (Not 1.0)

### Story
Pong. Cool noises. Cool music. Cool Effects.

### Screen Flow
Main Menu > Game Mode Select > Maps/Music > Game > End Screen


## Audience
### Target Audience
Our target audience will be for younger teenagers. The game will be suitable for 3+.

### Target Platforms
PC, Web, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android.

### Monetisation
The game will be free to play. (Possible move to a paid model because DLC would mean accounts)

The web version stays free to play, but doesn't receive more content.


## Audio
### Music
The music will be fast paces, electro, and with obvious beats.

### Sound
Sound will feel fast. Try to emulate the feeling beats from the songs with the menu sounds.


## Controls
Player 1 will control with W and S/Left Joy Up and Left Joy Down.
Player 2 will control with Up and Down/Right Joy Up and Right Joy Down.


## Accessibility
Reduced motion
No flashing colours
Assist mode (Singleplayer only) - Ball and sound and music slows (with slowdown effect) when it reaches the paddle. Paddle still moves at same speed.
